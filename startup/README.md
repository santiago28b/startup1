# startup
startup app for BYU CS260
[Link to Notes](notes.md)

### Elevator Pitch
it is a web app that you can use to manage and track your goal and habits. In this app you will
be able to create a new goal and track them, you can see how other people makes new goals and you can set a time to complete them days or weeks. The reason I want to build this app is that I want to have a place where I can see how I am doing with my goals and how I am improving.

### key features
1. Create account
2. add and remove habits
3.  add a counter to see how good you are doing
4.  see others people goals and get inspiration

### what tech will be used and how?
I will use basic HTML&CSS to make the website and then add JavaScript to add the functionality of calculations and manage goals.
I will also need the use of database, possibly MongoDB to store the information that needs to be saved.
I will also add API to display inspirational quotes so people can find support
I will use Websocket so the data of the new goals being created can be shared to the world
