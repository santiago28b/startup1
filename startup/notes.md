## Merging conflicts
I learned about how merging conflict can arise when working in teams and individually. I also learned the different commands and tools we can Use 
to fix the problems.
## Created a server and Created Github repository
I created an instance in AWS and it works fine
## DNS and Route53
Domain name system and Route 53 are used to create your domain and host it. once the domain has been leased AWS takes a while to process it and after that you can add records to it which basically means putting the desired IP address in the records so it links with your domain name. once you have done this you can use the domain to access your webpage instead of the ip address.
